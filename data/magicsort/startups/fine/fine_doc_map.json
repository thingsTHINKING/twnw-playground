The insurance then approves the claim & pays for a new roof, siding & gutters. The most the client will pay is their deductible. And in some cases, they pay nothing. This IS NOT your typical contracting work. With Accord Group, no one is getting into a bidding war, the client never has to pay for unexpected charges & insurance checks don't bounce. We do quality work & we know we are going to be paid for. Which produces a really productive business model.\",\"Picsart, the leading mobile destination for more creators.

As a B2B platform, our large health community becomes a cost-effective lead-gen funnel. Our first set of clients are life insurance companies: Acquisition economics in life insurance are painfully wasteful: 70% of their total cost is spent on acquiring new policyholders. Our products help them acquire high-quality leads at the lowest cost, dramatically improving their acquisition economics. Huge TAM: The top 10 US life insurance companies spend ~$6B each per year on customer acquisition (marketing awareness, lead generation, and sales conversion). They rely on traditional channels (TV, stadium sponsorships, google/Facebook ads) that are experiencing a decline in effectiveness as they are not focused on finding health-conscious consumers. Insurance companies know they need to innovate and find alternatives to these undifferentiated advertisements, and are looking for insurtech technologies and services to help with their ability to engage their most valuable leads more cost-effectively. How: Optimity helps insurance companies attract healthy customers, and keep them healthy, happy and engaged in a useful way to increase their lifetime value. Moat: The scale of our user base is exploding (we have over 1.3M users with verified emails).

Remote Business Is the FutureThere has been an evolution in the workplace over the last few years.

A growing number of companies are choosing to be distributed instead of in-person and even without physical offices are growing to valuations of more than a billion dollars. At Time Doctor, our focus is on allowing customers to build distributed teams that can work wherever and whenever they want, so the business can focus on allocating their office-running costs elsewhere.

Growth for today\\u2019s highest performing SaaS business is no longer sales-led, but driven by a self-serve, product-led motion. In this new world, companies have an abundance of data about their customers - including firmographic data (industry, geography, company size, title) and product usage data (who signed up, how many teammates they invited, what features are used, who the product champions are). But, this data lives in multiple different places - the data warehouse, CRM, marketing tools, and more - and the sales teams don't have the tools to access and analyze this data to inform their sales strategy. Simply put, the traditional enterprise sales tech stack is broken. Sales teams spend an overwhelming amount of time digging through data and switching between various tools to do their job. Pocus was founded to make data actionable for sales teams so they can work smarter. With Pocus, sales teams can focus on adding value to their customers, instead of digging through data. As the first ever platform to combine product engagement data with customer demographic data, we are giving sales reps access to insights that have never been available before. With this unique data, we enable sales teams to convert free / self-serve users to large paid customer contracts more efficiently and effectively.

We believe that by helping protocols solve token distribution, we\\u2019ll not only make crypto protocols more sustainable, but also help anyone in the world earn income through provable contribution rather than their background or credentials. RabbitHole has created an efficient way for protocols to distribute tokens by segmenting users based on on-chain & off-chain data. By completing on-chain tasks in various protocols, users build their on-chain resume, and earn token ownership. What problem are we solving? Protocols are constantly looking for new ways to find and engage users, but don\\u2019t have an easy way to do so. Tokens of these protocols often fall in the hands of speculators who sit on centralized exchanges, rather than users of these networks. On the other hand, new users in crypto have a difficult time in knowing where to start on their crypto journey and don\\u2019t know who to trust. Why are we solving this problem? By making it more efficient for protocols to distribute their token to network participants, we are both driving more participation to protocols and making it easier for users to increase their ownership in protocols rather than speculators. By increasing the number of token holders who are using the network, we are making the underlying protocol more sustainable, and putting more money in the pockets of users. Why are we different?

That's why they are adopting the Enterprise Metaverse in the form of Digital twins. From a survey conducted by Gartner, 75% of businesses want to implement digital twins, but only 13% have implemented it so far; the other 62% have it on their roadmap but find it hard or don't have the direct skill set in the team to implement it. After all, it's not a simple task to create a working, scalable, and living virtual replica of your factories in 3D. It's really complicated, requires a specialized 3D development team and specialized engineers to do the job; thus out of the reach of many businesses. This is where we step in to bridge the gap by bringing the capabilities of NoCode into a 3D workspace that allows businesses to build 3D apps without writing any code or having to depend on a 3D team. Our product, Cloudworx Studio, is a web-based IDE that lets users build applications and workflows for 3D content without writing any code.

Traditionally, the term Employee Health Benefits was synonymous with insurance / hospitalisation benefits only; ie, Secondary Care. Whereas today, 90% of individual healthcare and wellness related expenses in India are out of pocket on Primary Care; be it Mental Wellness, Fitness, Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medicines, and most of all, regular doctor appointments. The Covid-19 Pandemic has not only caused such expenses to increase multi fold, but also created a need for accessible systems. In a professional setting, such offerings are either lacking, or provided in an ad hoc, broken manner through various individual platforms. As a result, the experience for an employee is disconnected, with limited utilisation and engagement. This is where Visit Health comes in - a one stop solution for all employee health benefits needs. We help Companies build a Customized Wellness solution focused on Primary Care aspects such as Fitness, Mental Health, Doctor Teleconsultation, OPD programs, etc. for employees and their families, thereby reducing out of pocket expenses and creating healthier workforces.

Using our identity layer, we do full click-to-chain attribution that teases out what users are doing on-chain and why. Acquisition is the action of the growth stack: it's what we do with all the data we complied via identity and attribution. Whether you use influencers, tweets, or Discord posts, one Spindl link credits the right source for your user, and pays whatever creator or developer helped along the way (with no ads middlemen).\",\"We've built an intuitive platform which allows you to build and launch Web3 projects in a matter of clicks.

Our patented speech-based software technology that enables the user to customize the sound profile on their hearing device (whether hearing aids, hearables, earbuds) to their personal needs and preferences.\",\"Every day, millions of people are excluded from conversations because they cannot hear what others say well. Ava provides a way for them to be fully included in the conversation. Our CEO Thibault grew up in a Deaf family and saw firsthand how the world was not accessible for them. Together with our CTO Skinner \\u2014 deaf since age 2 \\u2014 Thibault co-founded Ava to make live captioning of conversations as easy as turning on captions on TV. Our small but fast-growing team has reinvented AI-based speech recognition technology to be in service of people who need it the most. We dream of a 24/7 accessible world, without any communication barrier. In this pursuit, we're seeing how much communication skills are critical, yet very far from ideal, to unleash our collective potential. This is for us the last barrier to be lifted. Our mobile app empowers individuals to see in close to realtime, who says what in the conversation. Ava swiftly pairs smartphones in a room and picks up all the audio from the conversation, to show a color-coded transcript of the speakers. At business meetings, family dinners, social gatherings, you simply launch the app, and Ava does the rest. Our belief is that well-designed technology can help everyone communicate and connect better \\u2014 much more effectively and authentically \\u2014 so humanity can achieve the greatest things together. We want to make the seemingly impossible equation of communication 1 + 1 = 3, work every time. In other words, make 1 & 1 = 3 a reality.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many restaurants began using QR codes and PDF menu displays in place of physical menus.

Currently, physical menus are limited to brief descriptions of meals with few visuals, not to mention the increased risk of spreading COVID-19. While PDFs and web-hosted options reduce the use of high-touch areas, they can be more difficult to navigate than traditional menus, and can be confusing for those who are less tech savvy. Foodi solves all these issues by reimagining the restaurant experience.

Hyre is a comprehensive HR platform that helps businesses of all sizes, across different industries, manage their shift-based workforce by providing the tools that enable them to thrive, including employee shift scheduling, automated timesheets, digital time clocks, team messaging, and a built-in temp staffing pool. But how did we get here?? Well... Hyre started as a hospitality platform aimed at transforming how event organizers (hotels and event venues) staff their events. Traditionally, when event organizers are short-staffed (which is 30-50% of the time), they call a traditional staffing agency that charges them an arm and a leg for staff who are getting paid minimum wage. These agencies operate in a manual fashion that results in poor quality, high costs, and unreliability to the event organizers. This is just 1 example of how the hospitality world is currently riddled with mundane processes that cost end users billions in inefficiencies, time, and human error. By creating a platform that allowed hospitality professionals to take control of their own staffing, Hyre was able to reduce our clients' costs by a minimum of 50%! But we didn't want to stop there... So, we expanded into new verticles (internal scheduling software) and industries (healthcare, logistics, etc). **Who do we work with?

We also empower providers - both installers and OEMs - a digital platform to engage more effectively with their customers.\",\"Almost everyone who will buy a solar plant in the 21st century has never bought one before. An average user does not have the past experience, the technical know how or even the financial support required to make this once in a lifetime purchase. Once the purchase has been made, this lack of experience and know how makes it difficult for the user to then get the maximum value out of their power plant. SafEarth has been built to bridge this gap. We operate an online platform that digitises the entire lifecycle of a solar plant - allowing users to get the best possible value out of their shift to clean energy. Our platform hand holds a user through the procurement, installation and maintenance phases of a solar project. This allows a user to get the highest possible return on investment from these assets while reducing the challenges and hassles faced by users. Our users are also able to raise low cost finance for their projects on our platform. Till date (May 2021), SafEarth platform has completed nearly 40MWs of solar projects for industries around the country. Today, these plants are saving nearly 70,000 Tonnes of Carbon emissions every year and saving our customers over Rs 12cr. in annual electricity expenditures.\",\"We are on a mission to accelerate solar adoption. The soft costs, currently, make up to 40% of the installation cost of any rooftop solar plant. Currently, either solar installers use thumb rule to install panels on a rooftop or spend way too much in doing manually iterations. The roof owner does not know what exactly they are buying as the generation potential estimates vary a lot from real site results. The Solar Labs is creating an AI-based SaaS solution for solar installers to optimize their sales and design process and equip the installers with a tool to estimate the true potential of any given rooftop. The Solar Labs\\u2019 tool is being used by some of the largest solar installers in India. The government bodies are also benefited by the tool and they use our automated solar potential assessment tool to do large scale analysis to issue subsidies and schemes for the same.\",\"Aurora Solar develops cloud-based software that enables sophisticated solar PV engineering design, provides workflow management functionality, and facilitates sales and customer acquisition for solar installers and financiers. Our software is used to create over 200,000 solar projects a month across the US and around the world.\",\"Everyone wants more renewable energy, but developing and building renewable energy projects is hard. There is a mess of legal documents, construction management, financial structuring, system designs, utility approvals, and much more. Euclid's technology organizes and simplifies this process for renewables developers and investors so they can build more projects, build them faster, and build them right. Euclid is developing a software platform that houses data, workflow, documents, compliance and risk items, and financial information about renewable energy projects. This enables solar developers and investors to spend more time building their projects and less time managing their data. Our platform is built from the founding team's years of experience developing, building, and investing in renewable energy projects. We already count some of the largest developers and investors in the industry as our clients. Our platform is built in Ruby on Rails, React, and Postgres.\",\"Nevados Engineering designs and manufactures solar mounting structures that can decrease the overall cost of solar power.\",\"At WattBuy, we\\u2019re focused on an ambitious vision: making cleaner, more affordable electricity accessible to every household.

Solar done right. Everbright has built the most comprehensive software toolset for the solar industry. Without Everbright, solar companies need to stitch together a patchwork of disparate solutions, which typically proves challenging and error-prone. As an independent software company, Everbright's goal is to \\\"democratize technology\\\" so that the entire solar industry (from huge national players to local general contractors) can run more efficiently and scale their businesses more rapidly. The Everbright platform is the first dedicated solar software toolset that supports the entire workflow for distributed generation (DG) solar. Our feature set supports multiple customer segments needed for successful solar deployment: sales/installation companies, financiers, and homeowners. Consolidating the entire solar sales workflow from lead to system activation into a single software platform drives significant efficiencies and allows for faster growth.\",\"Spright\\u2022ful (adj.): full of pure and clean energy.Solar should be simple, right now it isn't. At Sprightful, our mission is to give everyone access to the magic of solar energy. After 5 years of intense solar knowledge and experience, we've figured out a way to put solar on people's homes for free and resolved all their hesitations for homeowners to make the switch to solar.

This process of filtering out of focus, blurry, duplicates & closed eyes is a time consuming, tedious and tiring experience.

In the end, photographers give a quick review and export their final selections for editing.\",\"Aftershoot is the fastest and easiest way for photographers to select, rate, and edit their photos automatically.

Once those perfect photos have been selected, Aftershoot edits the images in the user's style in a matter of minutes, eliminating the need for thousands of tiny adjustments during the editing process. Aftershoot saves photographers hundred of hours of painstaking culling and editing. By automating the post-shoot workflow of photographers, they get spare time to focus on what really matters - engaging with clients, building portfolios, and recharging away from the computer.\",\"PhotoRoom provides photo editing software powerful enough to create outstanding images yet simple enough to be used without any training.

Hostels, PGs, Flats, Homestays, Shops, Godowns, Warehouses, Offices, Cloud spaces... 200 million Indians staying or doing business in rented properties and over 10 million owners actively renting out their properties. That's $400 billion of rent changing hands every year. And yet renting is tedious. We are making renting digital... We make it simple for owners to share their property details as a custom webpage, respond to bookings online, and accept digital payments easily. We are digitizing the tenant joining process. Digital KYC saves everyone's time of physically visiting the police station, lawyer, or notary to sign documents. We help owners collect their rent and bill dues on time by sending automatic reminders, tracking the late payees, and rewarding tenants who pay on time. How we started? What have we achieved? Being unhappy tenants in their school & college life, Srijan, Nimit & Manish built a 2 Cr/200 beds PG business while in college. Seeing the struggles of untimely rent collection, and inefficient rental processes, they launched an MVP in June 2019. Since then, we have scaled to over 1000 properties and 30000 tenants across India. We were one of the top 10 startups in Lightspeed Extreme Entrepreneur 2019.
