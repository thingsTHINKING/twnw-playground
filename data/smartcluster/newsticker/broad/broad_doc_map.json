Mit viel Liebe zum Detail entwickeln die hauseigenen Designer wandelbare Kinderm\\u00f6bel, die lange genutzt werden k\\u00f6nnen \\u2013 weil sie so durchdacht sind, dass sie Kinder vom ersten Tag an bis ins Teenageralter und dar\\u00fcber hinaus begleiten. Zahlreiche M\\u00f6glichkeiten zum Ausbauen, Umbauen und Erweitern sowie austauschbare Accessoires und Farbakzente schaffen Wohnwelten, die den Kindern lange gefallen und mit ihnen mitwachsen.     Sten Liege mit Baldachinaufbau und Motiv-Textilien Afrika Hochwertige Materialien f\\u00fcr langlebige M\\u00f6bel Auch bei den verwendeten Materialien legt PAIDI Wert auf Qualit\\u00e4t und Nachhaltigkeit, denn aus hochwertigen Rohstoffen entstehen langlebige M\\u00f6bel. Das Traditionsunternehmen verwendet ausschlie\\u00dflich H\\u00f6lzer aus heimischer oder europ\\u00e4ischer Forstwirtschaft, gr\\u00f6\\u00dftenteils PEFC- oder FSC-zertifiziert. Auf diese Weise werden auch lange Transportwege vermieden. Neben Massivholz setzt PAIDI f\\u00fcr den M\\u00f6belbau umweltfreundliche, emissionsarme Holzwerkstoffplatten ein, die zu 30\\u201350 % aus recyceltem Material bestehen. Auch bei den Textilien setzt PAIDI auf Recycling: So kommt beispielsweise im Textilbereich der Schoolworld ein neuer, hochwertigen Polsterstoff aus recycelten PET-Flaschen zum Einsatz.   Nachhaltigkeit mit Brief und Siegel PAIDI hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, nicht nur besonders ressourcenschonend zu produzieren, sondern auch alle direkten und indirekten CO2-Emissionen zu kompensieren. Dies geschieht durch die Unterst\\u00fctzung diverser Klimaschutz-Projekte und die Investition in Klimaschutzzertifikate \\u2013 und das schon seit 2016, als erster Kinderm\\u00f6belhersteller. Dar\\u00fcber hinaus wird im PAIDI-Produktionswerk Hafenlohr einiges getan: So wird dort ausschlie\\u00dflich Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien genutzt und mit energiesparender LED-Beleuchtung gearbeitet. Auch geheizt wird nachhaltig: mit Resten aus der Holzwerkstoffproduktion.  PAIDI ist seit 1973 in der DGM. Alle PAIDI M\\u00f6bel tragen das RAL G\\u00fctezeichen und sind so emissionsarm, dass sie den Blauen Engel tragen d\\u00fcrfen. Die Tische und Kastenm\\u00f6bel sind mit der besten Emissionsklasse A ausgezeichnet.

Das Colornetwork bietet ein Gegenmodell zum \\u201eFast-Fashion\\u201c, welches auch den Einrichtungsmarkt negativ beeinflusst, denn die Wahl der j\\u00e4hrlichen \\u201eSustained Color\\u201c gew\\u00e4hrleistet, dass die Farben zeitlos bleiben und sich immer wieder neu kombinieren lassen. Die Wahl findet durch ein Expertengremium aus Innenarchitekten, Produktdesignern und Trendexperten statt.    Die teilnehmenden Unternehmen verpflichten sich im Colornetwork zu Transparenz entlang der gesamten Wertsch\\u00f6pfungskette. Dies bietet den Vorteil, dass Planer, Bauherren oder Architekten sehen k\\u00f6nnen, wo und wie ein Produkt produziert wurde und welche Materialien und Stoffe darin enthalten sind und wie es um die Nachhaltigkeit steht.   Umwelt- und Verbraucherschutz sind laut H\\u00fclsta ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Markenkerns und werden durch die Partnerschaft erneut sichtbar gemacht. Das 1940 gegr\\u00fcndete Familienunternehmen sieht sich dazu verpflichtet M\\u00f6bel zu bauen, die in der Klimabilanz keinen Schaden f\\u00fcr nachfolgende Genrationen anrichte. \\u201eWir beteiligen uns gern an einer Initiative, die zur Wertsch\\u00f6pfung in unserer Branche beitr\\u00e4gt.

Im August 2022 wurde im Inland ein Plus von 32,94% gegen\\u00fcber dem Vorjahresmonat erzielt. Der Auslandsumsatz stieg sogar um 44,48%. Die Exportquote kletterte damit im August auf 44,84%.

Im Vergleich zum Vorjahresmonat August 2021 verzeichnete der Einzelhandel im August 2022 ein Umsatzminus von real 4,3% und nominal ein Umsatzplus von 5,4%. Die Differenz zwischen den nominalen und realen Ergebnissen spiegelt die hohen Preissteigerungen im Einzelhandel wider.  Einzelhandel mit Lebensmitteln auf niedrigstem realen Umsatzniveau seit Januar 2017  Der Einzelhandel mit Lebensmitteln verzeichnete im August 2022 im Vergleich zum Vormonat einen realen Umsatzr\\u00fcckgang von 1,7%.

Der Handel mit Textilien, Bekleidung, Schuhen und Lederwaren verbuchte ein Umsatzminus von 1,1% gegen\\u00fcber dem Vormonat und einen R\\u00fcckgang von 5,9% gegen\\u00fcber dem Vorjahresmonat.

Dabei zeigt der internationale Handels- und Dienstleistungskonzern, der seinen Gesamtumsatz im vergangenen Gesch\\u00e4ftsjahr stark auf 16,1 Milliarden Euro steigern konnte, eine unterschiedliche Entwicklung in den verschiedenen Gesch\\u00e4ftsfeldern. Ist die Otto Group in den ausl\\u00e4ndischen M\\u00e4rkten weiterhin klar auf Wachstumskurs, zeigt sich im konjunkturell st\\u00e4rker betroffenen Deutschland ein gegenteiliges Bild. So w\\u00e4chst die Otto Group im Ausland auf vergleichbarer Basis um 8,2 Prozent, ohne Bereinigung von Wechselkurseffekten sogar um 13,8 Prozent. In Deutschland dagegen sind die Ums\\u00e4tze im ersten Halbjahr 2022/23 um 13,5 Prozent auf vergleichbarer Basis zur\\u00fcckgegangen, ausgewiesen um 11,1 Prozent. Zu ber\\u00fccksichtigen ist, dass hier auch der R\\u00fcckgang beim handelsnahen Segment Services als unmittelbare Folge abnehmender Bestellungen eine relevante Rolle spielt. Da die gestiegenen Beschaffungs- und Energiekosten nicht 1:1 an die Kunden weitergegeben werden k\\u00f6nnen, hat sich auch das operative Ergebnis nach den ersten beiden Quartalen des Gesch\\u00e4ftsjahres 2022/23 verschlechtert.

Das f\\u00fchrt vermehrt zu Gro\\u00dfinsolvenzen \\u2013 besonders in einer Branche.  Berlin/M\\u00fcnchen \\u2013 Erst die Corona-Pandemie, jetzt der Ukraine-Krieg: Die Geschehnisse in den vergangenen Jahren haben viele Unternehmen stark belastet. W\\u00e4hrend erst Lieferkettenprobleme ein gro\\u00dfes Hindernis darstellen, machen jetzt die hohen Energie- und Rohstoffpreise vielen Betrieben zu schaffen.   Insolvenzen: Deutlich mehr Pleiten als 2021 Das f\\u00fchrt dazu, dass immer mehr Firmen Insolvenz anmelden m\\u00fcssen \\u2013 und das betrifft nicht nur die kleinen Unternehmen. Wie der Insolvenzreport der Unternehmensberatung Falkensteg zeigt, haben alleine in den vergangenen drei Monaten 33 deutsche Gro\\u00dfunternehmen mit mindestens 20 Millionen Euro Umsatz Insolvenz angemeldet. Zum Vergleich: Im Jahr zuvor waren es 74 Prozent weniger.   \\u201eDer Anstieg ist erwartbar, jedoch f\\u00e4llt er nicht so hoch aus, wie Anfang des Jahres von dem ein oder anderen erwartet\\u201c, erkl\\u00e4rt Falkensteg-Partner und Autor des Insolvenzreports Jonas Eckhardt. Er rechnet zwar damit, dass die Insolvenzen in diesem Jahr deutlich h\\u00f6her ausfallen werden als noch 2021, doch der Corona-Rekord wird wohl nicht geknackt werden. Im ersten Jahr der Pandemie meldeten n\\u00e4mlich 181 Gro\\u00dfunternehmen Insolvenz an.  Gro\\u00dfinsolvenzen: Besonders Autozulieferer schwer getroffen Besonders getroffen hat es im dritten Quartal dieses Jahres die Autozulieferer mit sieben Insolvenzverfahren. Dicht gefolgt von Maschinenherstellern und Nahrungsmittelherstellern mit jeweils f\\u00fcnf Verfahren.   Unser kostenloser Wirtschafts-Newsletter versorgt Sie regelm\\u00e4\\u00dfig mit allen relevanten News aus der Wirtschaft. Hier geht es zur Anmeldung.  Der gr\\u00f6\\u00dfte Betrieb, den die Krisen getroffen haben, ist der Autozulieferer Dr. Schneider mit 432 Millionen Euro Umsatz und 4500 Mitarbeitern. Auf dem zweiten Platz steht der bekannte Schuhh\\u00e4ndler G\\u00f6rtz mit 198,8 Millionen Euro Jahresumsatz und 1800 Mitarbeitern. Im September wurde bekannt, dass die Muttergesellschaft Ludwig G\\u00f6rtz GmbH ein Schutzschirmverfahren in Eigenverwaltung beantragt hat. F\\u00fcr zwei T\\u00f6chter wurde zudem ein Insolvenzverfahren in Eigenverwaltung beantragt.
